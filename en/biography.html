<section class="section reveal"><h2>Critical biography</h2><p class="lead">Pierluigi Monticone, known as Gigi Montico, was born in Malnate in 1943 and lives in Dovera. His training in Milan at the Scuola Superiore d'Arte (Castello Sforzesco) and Brera figure drawing courses shaped a technically grounded but experimental practice.</p><p>As a founder of Gruppo P4, Accademia del Sole and later Accademia del Sale, Montico debuted in 1968 in Milan. His trajectory then moved through figuration, spatial poetics, collage, material experimentation and ecological thought.</p><blockquote>The most coherent line in his work is the shift from the represented subject to the viewer's lived space.</blockquote></section>

<section class="section reveal"><h2>Poetic line</h2><p>Across the editorial sources, two axes persist: first, the fusion of color, movement, space and time; second, the progressive use of non-noble materials such as wood, cardboard and found objects. Montico's artistic biography is therefore also a biography of matter.</p></section>
